# Architecture Office Website for lunarcreation (responsive)

This is a hypothetical website for an architecture office, created using **HTML/ CSS**, **Tailwind CSS**, **JavaScript**, **React**, and **Vite**. It is my first project using this Stacks (React & Tailwind CSS) so I had to follow a guide to build it as a learning exercise.
